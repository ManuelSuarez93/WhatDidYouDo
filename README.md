What Did You Do? Is a game for the Women in Game's Jam 2025.

It is a narrative first-person puzzle game where exploration and observation are the key to progress. You play as Sofia, a woman in a therapy session that slowly turns into something far more unsettling. As you move through familiar spaces, you’ll have to solve puzzles hidden in everyday objects.
Your goal is to connect the clues, question what you see and decide what you believe.
